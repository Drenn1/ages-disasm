# About

This is intended to be a full disassembly of Oracle of Ages and Seasons for the Gameboy
Color. When combined with [LynnaLab](https://github.com/drenn1/lynnalab), it is a level
editing suite.

[See the wiki](https://wiki.zeldahacking.net/oracle/Setting_up_ages-disasm) for detailed
setup instructions.


# Required tools to build

* Python 2
* [WLA-DX](https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx) (A recent build is required)
** For Seasons to build properly, use [this branch](https://github.com/Drenn1/wla-dx/tree/emptyfill-banknumber). Otherwise, empty space won't be filled with the correct values (but the game will still work).
* [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/install.html) (Only required for windows users)


# Build instructions

Once the dependencies are installed, running `make` will build both games. To build
a specific game, run `make ages` or `make seasons`. (Don't try "make ages seasons"; make
will try to build them in parallel which doesn't currently work).

By default, the rom is built with precompressed assets, so that an exact copy of the
original game is produced. In order to edit text, graphics, and other things, run the
"./swapbuild.sh" script in the root of the repository. This will switch the build mode to
"modifiable" instead of "precompressed".

There are 4 build directories (for ages and seasons, vanilla or editable) which are
symlinked to the "build" directory depending on which game is built for which mode.

[See the wiki](https://wiki.zeldahacking.net/oracle/Setting_up_ages-disasm) for detailed
setup instructions.


## Tools needed to generate documentation
