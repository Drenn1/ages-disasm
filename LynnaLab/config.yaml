# Config for LynnaLab. DO NOT EDIT unless you know what you're doing. These
# config options are set or unset on specific branches of oracles-disasm so that
# LynnaLab knows what kind of data customization has occurred.


# Normally each area has "Main Gfx", "Unique Gfx", "Palette", and
# "Tilemap" variables. These all mix together to define how the area looks.
# This adds a confusing layer of indirection when editing areas.
# On certain oracles-disasm branches, all of that complexity has been removed,
# and each area simply has its own data for all of this. This uses more space in
# the rom.
