* Figure out what the rest of the treasures are
* Check: Do gasha seeds have an amount cap?

* Scripts in bank $15 could change unreliably when relocated, due to the variance on where
  "jump" commands go to (they either jump locally or to bank $c). Figure out how to fix this.
* Fix capitalization for variables named based on their addresses (inconsistent)
* Investigate compression:
    - Each room layout group ("plane") has $4000 bytes for its data (pointers use 14
      bits). Uncompressed small rooms can use up to $5000 bytes. Investigate further.
        - Large layout groups should have $10000 bytes.
* Interactions:
    - Should be possible to have interaction ids greater than $ef, not supported yet
          though
* WLA:
    - Add an option to optimize all "ld a,($ffxx)" opcodes to "ldh a,($xx)"
