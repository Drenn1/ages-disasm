; Treasure objects are a kind of Interaction (INTERACID_TREASURE). Each "Treasure Object" contains
; the information necessary to display a specific treasure (see "constants/treasure.s") and give it
; to Link. Many treasures need a "parameter" to go with them (ie. level, amount). All of this "extra
; data" is defined here.
;
; The "m_TreasureSubid" macro takes 4 bytes as parameters:
;   b0: bit 7    = next 2 bytes are a pointer
;       bits 4-6 = spawn mode
;       bit 3    = ?
;       bits 0-2 = grab mode
;   b1: Parameter (value of 'c' to pass to "giveTreasure")
;   b2: Low text ID on pickup ($ff for no text; high byte of ID is always $00)
;   b3: Graphics to use. (Gets copied to object's subid, so graphics are determined by the
;       corresponding value for interaction $60 in data/interactionData.s.)
;
; Then, the macro takes two more parameters:
;   Param 4: The treasure index (TREASURE_...)
;   Param 5: The name to give this new subid of the treasure index. This name will resolve to
;            a 4-digit hex number (XXYY, where XX = treasure index and YY = subid).
;
; If multiple subids are being specified for a single treasure, then parameter 4 is omitted and the
; "m_BeginTreasureSubids" macro must be used.
;
; For documentation of spawn modes and grab modes, see "constants/treasureSpawnModes.s".
;
; See also constants/treasure.s for treasure lists.
